My name is Nathan Tran and I am a computer science major at Cal State Fullerton and plan graduating in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, Part 1
  
  I really enjoyed doing our first lab together since it was basically my introduction to coding and I like to look back and    see how far I’ve gotten in coding. I feel like for the first lab it was a little tough to do but I was able to complete it    with no problems and fixing all the errors that I ran into for coding the first time.

* Lab 2, Part 1
  
  Learning how to use strings was a pretty important part of learning about computer science as there are so many different     codes that use strings. I learned line wrap as well which is also important and how to do things like create a new line       with “\n”.

* Lab 12, Part 2
  
  The final lab that we did on part 2 was really interesting for me as I had a little bit of trouble learning about the         random number generators but I was able to figure it out eventually. Once I got my code working, I found it really cool and   I was proud of myself for being able to create the animated gif from almost nothing.
